PlusPlus Battery gives you everything you ever wanted to know about your phone’s
battery — from simple level and power readings to deep-dive metrics.
It is designed and tested on modern OnePlus/Oppo/Realme devices,
but also works on most recent AOSP-based ROMs.

───────────────────
■  KEY FEATURES
───────────────────
• Real-time dashboard
  – Level, voltage, current, charge / discharge power
  – Works with and without root

• Battery-health estimation
  – Without root access: Calculates Full-Charge-Capacity when the
    battery is exactly 100 % and reaches 0 mA current

• Cycle-count history
  – Saves today’s cycle count to a local Room database each time you open the
    app, and shows the trend in a timeline view

• Persistent monitor notification
  – Ongoing notification-area battery monitor with customizable metrics

• Optional root mode
  – Reads additional sysfs nodes under /sys/class/oplus_chg/battery and some other directories, including
    • Current remaining capacity (battery_rm)
    • FCC (battery_fcc) and SOH (battery_soh)
    • Raw, uncompensated FCC/SOH values (especially for silicon batteries)
    • Under-voltage shut-down threshold (vbat_uv)
    • Battery serial number, manufacture date, Qmax, and more
  - Reads generic linux power supply files under /sys/class/power_supply/battery for universal devices
    • Customizable paths/titles/units for anything you want to read with root access

• Experimental
  - Gets battery data from logcat (root required)
    • Currently only some OPlus, Moto & Xiaomi devices are supported (depends on models and systems)

■  INSTALLATION
───────────────────
1. Make sure your handset runs a recent OxygenOS / ColorOS build or another
   up-to-date Android ROM.
2. Install the APK (or via F-Droid once this package is published).
3. Launch and grant the requested permissions.
4. (Optional) Grant root to unlock advanced metrics.
5. (Optional) To make the monitor service work as intended, disable battery optimisation for
   PlusPlusBattery and, on ColorOS 15, enable “Auto-launch”.
6. (Optional) For non-Oppo/OnePlus/Realme devices, you may want to disable the option 'Show OPlus exclusive entries' to hide those useless data under root mode.
